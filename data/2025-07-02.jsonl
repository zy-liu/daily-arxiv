Discrepancies between user queries and document\nphrasings often necessitate query rewriting.

To\nresolve this, we propose the R\\&R (Read the doc before Rewriting) rewriter,\nwhich involves continual pre-training on professional documents, akin to how\nstudents prepare for open-book exams by reviewing textbooks.

However, they suffer from data sparsity on\ntwo fronts: the dialogue space is vast and linguistically diverse, while the\nitem space exhibits long-tail and sparse distributions. Existing methods\nstruggle with (1) generalizing to varied dialogue expressions due to\nunderutilization of rich textual cues, and (2) learning informative item\nrepresentations under severe sparsity. To address these problems, we propose a\nCRS model named DACRS. It consists of three modules, namely Dialogue\nAugmentation, Knowledge-Guided Entity Modeling, and Dialogue-Entity Matching.\nIn the Dialogue Augmentation module, we apply a two-stage augmentation pipeline\nto augment the dialogue context to enrich the data and improve\ngeneralizability. In the Knowledge-Guided Entity Modeling, we propose a\nknowledge graph (KG) based entity substitution and an entity similarity\nconstraint to enhance the expressiveness of entity embeddings. In the\nDialogue-Entity Matching module, we fuse the dialogue embedding with the\nmentioned entity embeddings through a dialogue-guided attention aggregation to\nacquire user embeddings that contain both the explicit and implicit user\npreferences. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of DACRS."}

It aims to precisely filter\nthe massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream\ntool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on\noptimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise\nquery comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task\nsearch-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool\nretrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage\ndetection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval\ntower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for\neffective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent\nmodeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an\nadaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.\nBy jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and\ncontrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step\nsequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool."}

Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were\npublished, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate\nthem, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite\nthe rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group\nrecommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in\nacademic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group\nand how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue\nthat these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not\nmatch the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in\nthis research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI\nassistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we\nenvision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members\ninteract in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the\ndecision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a\nmore natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of\ngroup recommendation systems in practice."}

This study focuses on\nannotation for the search clarification task, leveraging a high-quality,\nmulti-dimensional dataset that includes five distinct fine-grained annotation\nsubtasks. Although LLMs have shown impressive capabilities in general settings,\nour study reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to replicate\nhuman-level performance in subjective or fine-grained evaluation tasks. Through\na systematic assessment, we demonstrate that LLM predictions are often\ninconsistent, poorly calibrated, and highly sensitive to prompt variations. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective human-in-the-loop\n(HITL) workflow that uses confidence thresholds and inter-model disagreement to\nselectively involve human review.

Existing KV Cache\nreduction methods face critical limitations: cache compression offers marginal\nacceleration given recommendation tasks' short decoding steps, while prompt\ncompression risks discarding vital interaction history. Through systematic\nanalysis of attention patterns in LLMRec, we uncover two pivotal insights: 1)\nlayer-wise attention sparsity inversion where early layers retain dense\ninformative patterns while later layers exhibit high redundancy, and 2) dual\nattention sinks phenomenon where attention scores concentrate on both head and\ntail tokens of input sequences. Motivated by these insights, we propose EARN,\nan efficient inference framework that leverages the early layers to compress\ninformation into register tokens placed at the input sequence boundaries, then\nfocuses solely on these tokens in the subsequent layers. Extensive experiments\non three datasets, two LLMRec methods and two LLM architectures demonstrate\nEARN's superiority, achieving up to 3.79x speedup and 80.8% KV Cache reduction\nwith better accuracy than the general finetuning approach.
